## 4. Project Implementation

### Data Scraping
The project starts by scraping the top 100 Netflix series data from the Rotten Tomatoes webpage. The scraper extracts the following information for each series:
- **Title**: Name of the Netflix series
- **Year**: Year of release
- **Genre**: Genre(s) of the series
- **Ranking**: Position in the "Top 100" list
- **Tomatometer Score**: Rotten Tomatoes critic score
- **Actors**: Main actors of the series
- **Links**: Link to the individual Rotten Tomatoes page

### Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Once the data is extracted, it's cleaned to remove unwanted characters, handle missing values, and format the data for further analysis.

### Data Visualization
The final dataset is imported into Power BI for visualization. Key visualizations include:
- **Genre distribution**: A bar chart showing the frequency of each genre in the top 100 series.
- **Top Netflix series**: A ranking visualization showcasing the highest-ranked series based on Tomatometer scores.
- **Year vs Rating**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between the release year and Tomatometer score.
